## Fake Library

# SUP PEEPS

We have theme and component files. The only component we have is a `Button`.

## Relevant repositories

* fake-library, equivalent of our future `component-library` (real name TBC)
* [fake-front-end](https://github.com/NuclearError/fake-front-end), equivalent of `checkout-front-end`

## Get started

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## What you should expect to see

When running the fake library on localhost, it should look something like this:
